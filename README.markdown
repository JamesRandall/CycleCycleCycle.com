# Introduction

CycleCycleCycle is an example of an ASP.Net MVC3 website built using dependency injection and Entity Framework code first following a pragmatic path of least resistance approach.

Controllers are kept clean and simple, and a service layer provides access to data through the use of the Unit of Work and Repository patterns.

The website is hosted and maintained on Azure at http://wwww.cyclecyclecycle.com
